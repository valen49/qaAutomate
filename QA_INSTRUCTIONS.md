This is a simple React app to test your ability to work with Cypress.

You can start the application running `npm start`

The original README is still available for any reference you may require.

Instructions:

1. Install, setup and configure Cypress


2. Write a test to make sure that the app renders without error


3. Write a test to ensure that the `notes` state loads with no entries (as an empty array)


4. Write a test to check that when an input value is added and the submit button is pressed that the note gets added to the `notes` state and that the note is rendered in the `ul`


5. Write a test to make sure that when the delete button is pressed that note is deleted from the `notes` list and that it is no longer present in the `ul`


6. When finished upload your test to Github and share the repo with us.

That's it, best of luck! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
